# Browser checks

The Blazor browser tools live outside the solution. Neither adds npm work to a normal .NET build.
`web-smoke.mjs` checks presentation/navigation without model calls; `flow-loadtest.mjs` sends real chat
requests and measures concurrent browser sessions.

## Setup

Install Playwright and Chromium in a temporary location:

```sh
mkdir -p /tmp/agentic-lab-loadtest
npm install --prefix /tmp/agentic-lab-loadtest --no-save --package-lock=false playwright
node /tmp/agentic-lab-loadtest/node_modules/playwright/cli.js install chromium
```

Start the application first, for example with `dotnet run --project src/AgenticLab.AppHost`, and set
`THESERIES_URL` to its externally reachable **web** resource, not the React frontend. The example port
below is illustrative; use the actual URL. The `THESERIES_*` names are retained for compatibility.

## UI smoke

Use a **Development** Web instance with a reachable AI service catalogue. The script creates isolated
browser contexts; it does not overwrite preferences in your own browser, send chat, reset server
conversations, or invoke rediscovery. No Azure model request is made by the script.

```sh
THESERIES_URL=http://127.0.0.1:5140 \
NODE_PATH=/tmp/agentic-lab-loadtest/node_modules \
node tools/web-smoke.mjs
```

Coverage includes 1440x1000, 1024x900, 390x844 and 1920x1080 viewports plus 200% CSS zoom:
conversation split/stack, draft retention between tabs, pointer/keyboard resizing, saved/legacy layout
restoration, reset, Execution maximise/collapse, independent Details/Learn docks, Discovery focus containment and Escape/backdrop
dismissal, lesson progression and detailed diagrams, shared-control states, reduced motion and 404
pages. It checks locally loaded fonts and page/toolbar overflow. Screenshots go to the system temporary
directory under `agentic-lab-web-smoke`; override with `THESERIES_SCREENSHOTS`.

The development catalogue is checked at `/design-system`. Separately verify a **published Production**
instance returns 404 there. `dotnet run --no-build` against development output is not a valid production
asset check; use `dotnet publish` and run the published DLL with its output as the content root.

This is not a replacement for live run verification. Auto/manual pacing, breakpoints, answers,
pause/resume/stop, replay and workspace-agent changes should also be exercised against a deterministic
local API or a configured service. A real service may incur model cost. The Web unit suite covers the
state and replay contracts without credentials:

```sh
dotnet test tests/AgenticLab.Web.Tests/AgenticLab.Web.Tests.csproj
```

## Load test

`flow-loadtest.mjs` exercises the Interactive Server Flow page with concurrent browser contexts.
The defaults are 10 concurrent users and 3 rounds.

Users run concurrently; rounds within each user's page run sequentially. The harness waits for Blazor
interactivity before filling the form and matches each submitted message to its new exchange. A failed
round is reported with its user/round and stops that user's remaining rounds. Against a real AI service,
this sends real model requests and can incur cost; use a fake API for an initial harness smoke test.

```sh
THESERIES_URL=http://127.0.0.1:5140 \
THESERIES_USERS=25 \
THESERIES_ROUNDS=5 \
NODE_PATH=/tmp/agentic-lab-loadtest/node_modules \
node tools/flow-loadtest.mjs
```

The JSON output reports `firstExchangeMs` (local exchange appearance, not the first backend event),
completion time, successful sample count, Chromium JS heap when available, and page/run errors.
The browser heap estimate may be rounded or shared across pages and is not total browser memory.
Missing servers and initialization failures return a nonzero exit code with an error message.
Record Web and AiService process working set, managed heap, allocation rate,
`AgenticLab.Web.Flow` metrics, `AgenticLab.AiService.Flow` metrics and latency from Aspire/OpenTelemetry
at the same time. Repeat the profile for idle tabs, active runs, paused/manual runs, long conversations,
New conversation and closed tabs. Run the profile before and after any CSR migration; it is not a CI test
and it does not claim to measure server managed heap by itself.
