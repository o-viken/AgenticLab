/// Resolves a vendor/brand key (sent by the web flow page when a brand theme is selected) to a

/// <remarks>
/// The catalog holds no prompt content itself: the per-vendor prompts are supplied by the injected
/// <see cref="IVendorHarness"/> implementations, whose <strong>original, representative</strong> content
/// lives in the Demo layer under <c>Demo/Vendors/&lt;Vendor&gt;</c> (so the Application layer stays free
/// of any Demo dependency). Those prompts are written in each vendor's spirit — not the vendors' real,
/// proprietary system prompts — and each keeps the essential tool-grounding operating rules so the agents
/// keep functioning. Keys are matched case-insensitively; an unknown or blank key resolves to <c>null</c>,
/// as does a vendor that supplies an <strong>empty</strong> harness (the non-brand <c>Default</c> vendor,
/// which is listed for its metadata but contributes no override), leaving the agent's own harness in place.
